## How to Use this Repo?

We categorize all the papers we read into several topics. You can navigate to the subfolder of each topic by clicking the corresponding link above. 

The `README.md` file in each subfolder contains the paper list for this topic. By default, Github will display this `README.md` file if you open this subfolder in the browser.  Besides the papers presented in our seminar, we also maintain a pool of interesting papers for reference.

We hope that, by following our reading group, beginners in this field will save their time for searching related work, and veterans can also track the research progress conveniently.
